# TypeScript: Types vs Interfaces - The Definitive Guide

## The Great TypeScript Dilemma

If you've spent any time with TypeScript, you've encountered this fundamental question:

> "Should I use a type or an interface here?"

It's a question that has sparked debates, divided teams, and caused countless developers to freeze mid-keystroke. Today, we're settling this debate once and for all.

## The Basics: First Impressions

At first glance, they seem interchangeable:

```typescript
// Interface approach
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

// Type approach
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

But beneath this apparent similarity lies a world of subtle differences that can make or break your TypeScript project.

## Key Differences That Actually Matter

### 1. Extension vs Intersection

Interfaces are designed to be extended, while types can be intersected:

```typescript
// Interface extension
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  bark(): void;
}

// Type intersection
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

type Dog = Animal & {
  bark(): void;
};
```

In the type world, we're saying, "a Dog is an Animal AND it has these additional properties." This subtle difference matters when your types get complex.

> Interface বলে: "আমি ঘোড়া, কিন্তু হাতির বৈশিষ্ট্যও নিতে পারি।"  
> Type বলে: "আমি ঘোড়া এবং হাতি, একই সাথে!"

### 2. Declaration Merging

Only interfaces can be merged if declared multiple times:

```typescript
// This works fine with interfaces
interface Superhero {
  name: string;
}

interface Superhero {
  powers: string[];
}

// Equivalent to:
// interface Superhero {
//   name: string;
//   powers: string[];
// }

// This causes an error with types
type Hero = {
  name: string;
};

// Error: Duplicate identifier 'Hero'
type Hero = {
  powers: string[];
};
```

This feature makes interfaces particularly useful for library authors who need to allow consumers to augment existing types.

## Performance: The Hidden Factor

Here's something rarely discussed: there can be performance differences in how TypeScript processes types versus interfaces, especially in large projects:

```typescript
// Can be more performant with large object structures
interface HugeObject {
  // 100+ properties
}

// Might cause more processing overhead in the compiler
type HugeObject = {
  // 100+ properties
};
```

TypeScript's structural type system behaves differently with interfaces (which it was originally designed for) versus type aliases (added later).

## The Definitive Decision Tree

Use **interfaces** when:

- You're creating object-oriented hierarchies
- You need declaration merging
- You're writing a public API or library
- You need `implements` functionality with classes

Use **types** when:

- You need union or intersection types
- You need mapped or conditional types
- You're working with tuples or complex function types
- You prefer immutability (since types can't be re-opened)

## Real-World Example: React Components

For React developers, the choice matters:

The type approach makes it easier to combine your props with React's built-in types using intersection.

## The TypeScript Team's Perspective

The TypeScript team themselves have evolved in their recommendations:

> "For the most part you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use interface until you need to use features from type." - TypeScript Handbook

## Conclusion: The Pragmatic Approach

After years of TypeScript development, most seasoned developers adopt this approach:

1. Start with interfaces for object shapes by default
2. Switch to types when you need their specific capabilities
3. Be consistent within a project
4. Document your team's choices

Remember that in the end, both are just tools to help you write safer, more maintainable code. The real TypeScript mastery comes not from dogmatically choosing one over the other, but from understanding when each one shines.

Like we say in Bangla: "ধীরে চলো, দূর যাও". Take the time to understand these nuances, and your TypeScript journey will be smoother for it.
